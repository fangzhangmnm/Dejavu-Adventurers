Entry denied.\nAdventurer: Captain Galen, please reconsider! We come with urgent news from the nearby village of Glimmerbrook. A horde of undead is preparing to attack Eldoria.\nCaptain Galen: *skeptical* Undead, you say? That's not an excuse to bypass the city's regulations.\nAdventurer: *leaning forward* Listen, Captain, we understand the importance of security, but time is of the essence. Lives are at stake. Surely, there must be something we can do to gain entry?\nCaptain Galen: *crossing arms* I'm afraid not. Our rules are strict for a reason.\nAdventurer: *sincerely* Captain Galen, please. We risked our lives to bring this information. Surely, the safety of the city is worth bending the rules a bit.\nCaptain Galen: *stern* Rules are rules. If you can't abide by them, then leave.\nAdventurer: Captain, we understand the importance of your duty. Would a little compensation help you look the other way, just this once?\nPlayer offers a pouch of gold to Captain Galen.\nCaptain Galen: *hesitates, torn between duty and the gold.* Fine. But this better not come back to haunt me. *reluctantly* You have one day, and then you're out.\n"

We come as Emissaries from a distant land, seeking to share tales of adventure and knowledge with the people of Eldoria.\nCaptain Galen: *raising an eyebrow* Emissaries, you say? I'm not easily swayed by flowery words. Show me your credentials.\nAdventurer: *enthusiastically* Of course, Captain! We have a letter of recommendation from a respected scholar back in our homeland. He praised our wisdom and contributions to our community.\nPlayer presents the letter to Captain Galen.\nThe letter was hastily wrote just a moment ago, and lack of any specific details about the party's supposed achievements.\nCaptain Galen: *scans the letter* Hmm..., *displeased* This letter seems dubious at best. I find it hard to believe that a respected scholar would pen such a vague endorsement.\nAdventurer: *nervously* Captain, we are being honest in our intentions. We really do possess valuable knowledge and experiences to share.\nCaptain Galen: *frowning* Words are cheap. If you truly have something to offer, then prove it with actions, not empty promises.\nAdventurer: *desperately* Captain, please! We have traveled a long way to reach Eldoria. Surely, you can make an exception for us?\nCaptain Galen: Stop wasting my time. If you keep this up, I'll have you arrested for disturbing the peace.\nAdventurer: We mean no harm, Captain. It seems diplomacy has failed us, but we won't back down from our mission. If you won't let us pass peacefully, we'll have no choice but to force our way through!\nCaptain Galen: *angered* You dare threaten me in my own city? You'll regret that!\n"
