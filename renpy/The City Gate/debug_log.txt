Guard's Diary

I stood at the city gate, my eyes fixed on the approaching adventurer. As they
neared, I barked at them to halt, demanding to know their purpose and see
their documentation. The insolent fool had the audacity to insult me, calling
me a bastard. I warned them to watch their tongue and show respect,
threatening to ban them from the city. But they continued their insults,
calling me an idiot. My pride was wounded, and I vowed to ensure they would
never enter the city, reporting their insolence to the authorities.

You end up fighting the guard.
