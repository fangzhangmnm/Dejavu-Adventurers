Guard's Diary Day 2

Captain Galen writes in his diary about encountering the player again, who has
become a royal advisor. He expresses his disdain for the player's excitement
and mentions that Eldoria is a city of order and discipline. He warns the
player not to cause any disturbances and dismisses their offer to show him
water magic tricks. He ends by reminding them that he is in charge and bids
them farewell.

Guard's Diary

Captain Galen, being his usual greedy and stubborn self, demands documentation
from the adventurers at the city gate. When Aqua tries to charm him with
promises of entertainment and water magic tricks, he dismisses her and insists
on proper documentation. However, after examining the well-signed documents,
Aqua tries once more to convince him, this time appealing to his pride and
arrogance by promising to bring joy, laughter, and adventure to the people of
Eldoria. Reluctantly, Captain Galen agrees to let them in, but warns them of
the consequences if they cause any trouble.
